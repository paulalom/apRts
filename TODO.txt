This is not an ordered or an exhaustive list.

Draw archetecture diagrams for all of the good reasons
Refactor everything into more ECS/data oriented design
Continue decoupling from unity as needed. Prefer decoupling over coupling where reasonable

Redo Terrain generation to be more suitable to RTS 
	- Random polygon tiles w/ noise?
		- Redo safezones
	- Discrete heights
Continue Subsystem work
	- Allow for damage, repair, and positioning of subsystems
	- Generic hardpoints on entities
Large Unit System (extension of subsystems)
	- Allow transport units to contain other units
	- Use Hardpoints to place unit at point on transport
	- Unit can shoot, take damage from position on transport
Empire Economy and Production
	Cities, population with demands, produces income, manpower, goods
		- Key nodes where cities can form, and they grow outwards as resources are available?
		- Expands automatically or manually to nearby safe nodes
		- Trades with neighbouring cities/military bases
		- Fully AI Controlled?
	Military bases
		- More player control than with cities		
	Logtistics networks
		- Transports + Nodes
			- Tracked Transports (eg. trains, planes on a virtual track)
			- Free Transports (eg. trucks, free-flying cargo planes), 
			- Logistic Network nodes (stationary storage objects)
Power networks
	- Relay objects, consuming structures (civilian buildings, defense buildings, etc.)
Commander Ability Structure
	- Hero/empire categories
	- Something more nuanced than a tree
		- Allow for taking points into either category
		- Doesnt penalize hybrids
Political System
	- Chat/Messaging
	- Trade
	- Contracts/missions issued by players to players or neutral mercs
Planetary System
	- Discrete world system 
		- Launch to orbit
			- Takes some time, fuel
			- Teleports unit to other "zone" (eg. on planet, in solar system, interplanetary space)
	- Player Start Location Selection (which planet, star, sector)
		- Will need ever expanding number of planets (new players, respawning players)
			- Events/hostile species could reclaim sections of space to reduce rate of expansion
Information Systems
	- Fog of war
	- Comm/Order range/delay? between "zone"s? 
		- Probably not, likely tedious to micro
		- Maybe some sort of expedition system allowed to explore
			- Cheap+Expendable, but doesnt return information until unit returns from region
AI
	- Configurable management of Player's objects to reduce micro requirements
	- Manage player while offline
		- Needs to be good enough to not be a significant disadvantage
		- Other solutions can assist (eg. defense cheating while offline, natural defense advantage)
	- Manage Non-Player units/factions
Game Content
	- Story, Races + Units, Events
User Assist/Enjoyability
	- Need ways to help slow players keep up. Strategy should be more about planning than executing
	- Formation builder
	- Want empires to expand as much as possible, don't want large gaps in universe
		- Civilization (income structures, consumer goods, non-millitary industry) is ai only/mostly ai? 
		- Manual expansion is micro-intensive
		- Players will stop expanding if they think they have enough, but empire should never stop
			
UI
	- Settings to filesystem instead of code
	- Command bar
		- Radar
		- Selection Display
			- Single Unit Status
			- Multi-Unit Status
	- Resource Bar
		- What should it desplay? No global resources
			- Commander Resources?
			- Curernt selection Resources?
	- Unit Hover Info
		- Various Health+Energy bars
			- Setting to make these persist, enabled by default?
		- Inventory?
		- Overlay damage info onto unit 
			- 2d Icon? Or tint various parts of unit according to health?
			
Release plans/roadmap for growth
	- pick a niche to start with?
	- release several games built with the engine, use areas of overlap to link them together for final games?
		- eg. sim city for economies, small RTS emphasising politics, player contracts... overhead RPG using component system for unit customization)
